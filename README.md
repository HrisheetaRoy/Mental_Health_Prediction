# Mental Health in Tech Survey Analysis

This project analyzes mental health trends in the tech industry using survey data. It includes a complete pipeline for exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The goal is to identify whether a person is likely to seek mental health treatment based on their responses.

## Features

- EDA notebook to explore distributions, missing values, and outliers
- Clean and modular Python scripts for each stage of the pipeline
- Preprocessing handles:
  - Dropping irrelevant columns
  - Missing value imputation
  - One-hot encoding
- Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict mental health treatment likelihood
- Evaluation includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Saves trained model as `.pkl` for future use
- Predicts on new data using saved model and features

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
 https://github.com/HrisheetaRoy/Mental_Health_Prediction.git
 cd Mental_Health_Analysis

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

python -m venv .venv  
Activate (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate
Activate (Mac/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate


### 3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Project

### 1. Run Full Pipeline (Data Load â†’ Clean â†’ Train)

python main.py


This will:
- Load and preprocess the survey data
- Train a Random Forest model
- Save the model to `outputs/models/random_forest_model.pkl`
- Save the feature column order to `feature_columns.json`

### 2. Run a Prediction on New Data

python predict.py


This will:
- Load the trained model and expected features
- Predict the mental health treatment likelihood for a manually defined sample

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey). It contains responses from tech workers about mental health support in their workplaces.

## Model Details

- **Classifier**: Random Forest
- **Target variable**: `treatment` (binary: Yes/No)
- **Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical features
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
